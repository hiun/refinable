### Abstract
Self-composable Programming(Self) is a technique for Software Product Line Engineering to manage variability on software feature implementation. Self bring an object-oriented approach to increasing modularity by localising scattered and so tangled behavior - the ***commonalities*** to ***abstract function*** and ***variabilities*** to inherited ***specific function*** by applying refinement. Programming-level compositional approach on software modularity include metaprogramming or aspect-oriented programming works well while Self provides different advantages, Self is nothing new, does not requires special compiler or language feature but fully used the vision and idea provided since SIMULA67, which is *modeling the real world*. I am sure Object-oriented Programming is good at modeling ***things*** but not ***behaviors***, while the concept, Object-orientation could suitable for this and Self provides a practical approach to modeling of modern software behavior by bringing ***hierarchical relationship*** as you seen below in the example of a web application.
